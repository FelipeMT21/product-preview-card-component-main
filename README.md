## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
  <div class="container">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  align-self: flex-start;
}
```

### Continued development

To further enhance my design skills, I plan on delving deeper into Grid and Flexbox in order to gain a better understanding of these tools and use them more fluidly. This will expand my possibilities for creation and allow me to design more complex and sophisticated layouts.

### Useful resources
